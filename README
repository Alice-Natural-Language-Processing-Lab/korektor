Korektor
========

Korektor is a statistical spellchecker and (occasional) grammar checker released
under 2-Clause BSD license (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) and
versioned using Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).

Korektor started with Michal Richter's diploma thesis Advanced Czech
Spellchecker (https://redmine.ms.mff.cuni.cz/documents/1), but it is being
developed further. There are two versions: a command line utility (tested on
Linux, Windows and OS X) and a REST service with publicly available API
(https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/korektor/api-reference.php) and HTML front
end (https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/korektor/).

The original OS X SpellServer providing System Service integrating Korektor with
native OS X GUI applications is no longer developed, but do not hesitate to
contact us if you are interested in it.
