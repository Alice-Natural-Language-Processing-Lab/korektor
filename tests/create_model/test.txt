They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?
The upstart pertensins of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .
Is this to be Tndured !
But it must not , shall not be .
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sptere in which you have been brought up . "
" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
" True .
You are a gentleman 's daughter .
But who was your mother ?
Who are your uncles and aunts ?
Do not imagine me ingorant of their condition . "
" Whatever my connecTions may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . "
" Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment 's delberation :
" I am not . "
Lady Catherine seemed pleased .
" And will you promise me , Vever to enter into such an engagement ? "
" I will make no promise of the kind . "
" Miss Bennet I am Shocked and astoRnished .
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .
I shll not go away till you have gqiven me the assuraece I require . "
" And I certainly never shall give it .
I am not to be intimidaTed into anything so wholly unreasonable .
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable ?
Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cLan not tell ; but you have certainly no righT to concern yourself in mine .
I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farthJer on the subject . "
" Not so hasty , if you please .
I have by no means done .
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another tto add .
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisEer 's infamous elopement .
I know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .
And is such a girl to be my nepMew 's sister ?
Is her husband , is the son of his late fathGer 's steward , to be his brother ?
Heaven and earth ! -- of what are you thinking ?
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
" You can now have nothing further to say , " she resentfully answered .
" You havE insulted me in every possible method .
I must beg to return to the house . "
And she rose as she spoke .
Lady Catherin rose also , and they turned back .
Her laydship ws highly incensed .
" You have on regard , then , for thEe honour and credit of my nephew !
Unfeeling , selfish girl !
Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
" Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say .
You know my sentiments . "
" You are then resolved to have him ? "
" I have said no such thing .
I am only resolved to cat in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without rference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "
" It is well .
You refuse , then , to oblige me .
Yqu refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratiutde , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
No principle oKf either would be violated by my marriage with Mr . Darcy .
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern -- an the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "
" And this is your real opinion !
This is your final resolve !
Very well .
I shall now know how to act .
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
I came to try you .
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , I will carry my point . "
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .
I send no compliments to your mother .
You deserve no such attention .
I am most seriously displeased . "
Elizabeth made no aDswer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
Her mother impaatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why Lad Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "
" She is a very fine-looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously ciil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so , passig through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
i suppose she had nothing particular to saX to you , Lizzy ? "
Elizabeth was fmorced to give into a little falsEhood here ; for to acknowledge the substance sof their conversation was impossible .
hpater 57
The discomposure of spirits which thIs extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
Lady Catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy .
It was a rational scheme , to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , t a time when the expecttion of one wedding made evrybody eagre for another , to supply the idea .
She had not herself forgotten to feeW that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequeNtl together .
And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge , therefore ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached Lady Catherine ) , had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
In revolving Lady Catherine 's expressions , however , Pshe could not help feeling some uneasiness as to mhe possilbe consequence of her persisting in this interference .
From what ste had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for Bis aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
If he had been waveriong before as to what he should do , which had often seemjd likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determiine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
In that case he wGould return no more .
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagemetn to ingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keepinyg his promise should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know hOw to undlrstand it .
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
* * * * *
The surprise of the rest of the family , on eharing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they boligingly satisfied it , with the samn kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs . Bennet 's curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject .
The next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met b her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
It suddenly struck her that it might be from LaDy Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
She followed her father to the fre place , and thBy Both sat down .
He then said ,
" I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
As it principally concerns yoourself , you ought to know its Contents .
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being c letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended thpt his letter was not rather addressed to herselF ; when her father continued :
" You look conscious .
Young ladies have great penetration in suh matters as these ; bGut I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
This letter is from Mr . Collins . "
" From Mr . Collins ! and what can he have to say ? "
" Something very much to the purpose of course .
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , ti seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , gossiping Lucases .
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
What relates to yourself , is as follows : ' Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of Another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the choen partner of her fate may b reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious persoNages in this land . '
" Can yu possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " ' This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiRre , -- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Yet in spite of all these emptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evivls you may incur by a precipitate closue with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined ot take immediate advantage of . '
" Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
But now it comes out :
" ' My motive for cautioning you is as follows .
We have reason to imagine that his aunT , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . '
" Mr . Drcy , you see , is the man !
Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .
Could he , or the dLucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more fefectually to what they related ?
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
It is admirable ! "
Elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
" Are you not diverted ? "
" Oh ! yes .
Pray read on . "
" ' After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never gvLe her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . '
Mr . Collins moreover adds , ' I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concernEd that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
It wAs an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .
You ought certainly to forgive them , as a Christian , but never to anmit them in your sight , or alLow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . '
That is his notion of ChKristian forgiveness !
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , nd his expectatIno of a young olive-branch .
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
You Mre not going to be missish , I hope , and pretenAd to be affronted at an idle report .
For what do we live , Lbut to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
" Oh ! " cried Elizabeht , " I am excessively diverted .
But it is so strangne ! "
" Yes -- that is what makes it amusing .
Had they fixed on any other man t would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
Nay , when I read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the imudence and hypocrisy of emy son-in-law .
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?
Did she call to refuse her consent ? "
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspijion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make Fer feelings appear what they were not .
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at uch a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , nstead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Chapter 58
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he as able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine 's visit .
The gentlemen arriveF earLy ; and , before Mrs . Bennet had time to tlel him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all waking out .
It was agreed to .
Mrs . Bennet was not in the habit of walking ; Mary could never spare time ; but the remaining five set off together .
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy were to entertain each other .
Very little was aid by eitHer ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to alk ; Elizabeth waa secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth aw no occasion for making it a general concer , when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .
Now was the moment for he Bresolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said :
" Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relieF to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding yours .
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
vEer since I have known it , I have beeun most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my owN gratitude to express . "
" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
I did not think MIrs . Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
" You must not blame my aunt .
Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my Family , for that generous compassion which induced you to tke so much troJble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
" If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yoursealf alone .
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not Xttempt to deny .
But your family owe me nothing .
Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of you . "
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a wor .
Atfer a Short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me .
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
Elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluentQly , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive iwth gratitgde and pleasure his present assurances .
The happiness hwich this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed ot do .
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over hHs face , became him ; ut , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was t him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .
There was ptoo much to be thought , and felt , and said , ofr attention to any other objects .
She soon learn that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts f his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyship 'S apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavous to obtain that prOmise from her nephew which she had refused to give .
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , Had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . "
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
After abusing you so aboinably to your face , I could have nO scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
" What did you say of me , tha I did not deserve ?
For , though your accsatoins were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had erited the severest reproof .
It was unpardonable .
I can not think of it without abhorrenec . "
" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " aid Elizabeth .
" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we Yave both , I hope , improved in civility . "
" I can not be so easily reconciled to myself .
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexPressibly painful to me .
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . '
Those were your words .
You know not , oyu can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; -- though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
" I was certainly very far from expectng them to make so strong an impression .
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
" I can easily believe it .
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
" Oh ! do not repeat what I then said .
These recollections will not do at all .
I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
Darcy mentioned his letter .
" Did it , " said he , " ddi it soon make you think better o me ?
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
She explatned what its effecT on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
I hope you have destroyed the letter .
There ws one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
" The letter shAll certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to Qthink my opinions hot entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that impliOs . "
" When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
The adieu is charity itself .
But think no more Zf the letter .
The feelnings of the person who wrote , and the person who recEived it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circuNmstance attending it ought to be forgotuten .
You musT learn some of my philosophy .
Think nly of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
" I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
But with me , it is not so .
Painful recollections will intrude hwHich can ndot , which ought not , to be repelled .
I have been a selfish bein all my life , in practice , though not in principle .
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride aNd conceit .
Unforunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , I was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my fatheRr , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest EliZabeth !
What do I not owe you !
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , buT most advantageous .
By you , I was properly humbled .
I came t you without a doubt of my reception .
You showed mc how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "
" Indeed I had .
What will you think of my vanity ?
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
" My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I asSure you .
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .
How you must have hated me after that evening ? "
" Hate you !
I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at Pemberley .
You blamed me for coming ? "
" No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "
" Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . "
" My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain yoUr forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I ad seen you . "
He then told her of Georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointmen at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause eof that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
She expressed her gratitude again , but iK was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth .
" Not at all .
When I went away , I feqlt that it would soon happen . "
" Tphat is to say , you had given your permission .
I guessed as much . "
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he , " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
His surprise was great .
He had never had the slightest suspicion .
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "
Elnizabeth coUld Inot help smilin at his easy manner of directing his friend .
" Did ou speak from your own observation , " said she , " wheQn you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
" From the former .
I had narrowly observed her during the two visis which I had lately made here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "
" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immdeiate conviction to him . "
" It did .
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
His diffidence had prevented His depending on his own judgment in so anBious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy .
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , fofended him .
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last wSnter , that I had known it , anud purposely kept it from him .
He was angry .
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer thna he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments .
He has heartily forgiven me now . "
Elizabeth longed to observe thAt Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too earlTy to begin .
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
In the hall they parted .
Chapter 59
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
She had only to say in reply , Uhat they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary .
The acknowledtged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows In mirth ; and lEizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
She anticipated what would be felt in the fAmily when her situation became knonw ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and cOnsequence might do away .
At night she opened her hcart to Jane .
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
" You are joking , Lizzy .
This can not be ! -- engaged to Mr . Darcy !
No , no , you shall not deceive me .
I know it to be impossible . "
" This is a wretched beginning indeed !
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .
I speak nothing but the truth .
He still loves me , and we are engaged . "
Jane looked at her doubtingly .
" Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be .
I know how much you dislike him . "
" You know nothing of the matter . That is ll to be forgot .
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .
But in such cases as these , a good memory iYs unpardonable .
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "
Miss Bennet sitll looked all amazement .
Elizabeth Again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
" Good Heaven ! can it be really so !
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane .
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would -- I do congratulate you -- but are you certain ? forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
" There can be no xoubt of that .
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
But are you pleased , Jane ?
Shall you like to have such a brother ? "
" Very , very much .
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .
ut we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
And do you really love him quiTe well enough ?
Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection .
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
" Oh , yes !
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "
" What do you mean ? "
" Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
I am afraid oyu will b angry . "
" My dearest sister , now be serious .
I want to talk very seriously .
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .
But I bKlieve I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds aT Pemberley . "
Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish .
" Now I am quite hadppy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .
I always had a vaue for him .
Were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your husbanD , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved wth me .
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !
I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . "
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had mAde her equally avoid the name of his friend .
But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia 's marriage .
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
* * * * *
" Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " iB that disagreekable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bignley !
What can he mean by being so tireosme as to be always coming here ?
I had o notion but he would go a-shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
What shall we do with him ?
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's way . "
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was realy vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her s expressiveLy , and shook hands with such warmth , as leUft no doubt of his good information ; aNd he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mrs . Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts In which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? "
" I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . Bennet , " to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . "
" It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " buBt I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .
Wo n't it , Kitty ? "
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Daorcy professeD a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .
As she went up stairs to get ready , Msr . Bennet followed her , saying :
" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you shoUld be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
But I hope yoc will not mind it : it is all for Jqne 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
So , do not put yourself to Bnconvenience . "
During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet 's consent should be asked iN the Lcourse of hte evening .
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
She could not determine how Her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
But hether she were violently set aganist the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain thao her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures o her joy , than the first vehemence of hHer disapprobation .
* * * * *
In the eVening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
She did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her means -- that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing ocf her -- was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
She was gone directly .
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Have not you always hated him ? "
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , With some confusion , Of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .
" Or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have Hore fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .
But will they make you happy ? "
" Have you any other objection , " said Eilzabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "
" None at all .
We ll know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
" I do , I do like him , " she replIed , with tears in her eyes , " I love him .
Indeed he has no improper pride .
He is perfeCtly amiable .
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
" Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent .
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
But let me advise you to think better of it .
I know your disposition , Lizzy .
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
You know not what you are about . "
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assUrances tat Mr . Darcy was really the oBject of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection KQas not the woRk of a day , but had stood the test of many months ' suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say .
If this be the case , he deserves you .
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .
He heard her with astonishment .
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed !
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
So much the better .
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Had it bnen your uncle 's doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lWovers carry every thing their own way .
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
He tehn recollected her EmbarraKssment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some tme , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for MaR or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "
Elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection iN her own room , she was able to join the wthers with tolerable composure .
Every thing was too recent for Hgaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
When her mother went up to her dressinG-rom at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
Nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
" Good gracious !
Lord blpess me ! only think ! dear me !
Mr . Darcy !
FWho would have thought it !
And is it really true ?
Oh ! my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will bje !
What pin-money , what jewels , what carriagex you will have !
Jane 's is nothing to it -- nothing at all .
I am so pleased -- so happy .
Such a charming man ! -- so handsome ! so tall ! -- Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked hmi so much before .
I hope he will overlook it .
Dear , dear Lizzy .
A house in town !
Every thing that is charming !
Three daughters married !
Ten thousand a year !
Oh , Lord !
What will become of me .
I shall go distracted . "
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not Sbe doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think Ef nothing else !
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a Lord !
And a special licence .
You must and shall be married by a special licence .
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow . "
ThiBs was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself mIght be ; and Elizabeth found that , though n the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .
But the morrow passed off much better than she expecgted ; for Mrs . Bennet luckily stood in sduch awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak tb him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her fatHer taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
" I admire all my three sons-in-law highly , " said he .
" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane 's . "
Chapter 60
Elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
" How could you begin ? " said she .
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
" I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
It is too long ago .
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . "
" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
" For the lievlinesEs of your mind , I did . "
" You may as well call it impertinence at once .
It was very little less .
The fact is , that you were sick Of civility , of deference , of officious attention .
You Were disgusted with the wOmen who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for your approbation aloe .
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .
Had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took tfo disguise yourself , yOur feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the eprsons who so assiduously courted you .
There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting ofr it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . "
" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield ? "
" YDearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ?
But make a virtue of it by all means .
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to e to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling tRo come to the point at last .
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?
Wy , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
" But I was embarrassed . "
" And so was I . "
" You might haev talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
" A man who had felt less , might . "
" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !
But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !
My resolution of thanking yoY for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . Too much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? for I ought not to have mentioned the suBject .
This will never do . "
" You need not distress yoursejlf .
The moral will be perfectly fair .
Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts .
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours .
My aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "
" Lady Catherine has been of infinitGe use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .
But tell me , what did you come own to Netherfield for ?
Was it merely to ride to Longboun and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
" My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "
" Shall you Ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall heR ? "
" I am more likely to want more time than courage , Elizabeth .
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
From an unkillingness to confess how much her initmacy with Mr . Darcy ahd been over-rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . Gardiner 's long letter ; but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashameN to find tHat her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows :
" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactoy , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .
You supposed more than really existed .
But now suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in evcry possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err .
oYu must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Laks .
How could I be so silly as zo wish it !
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .
We will go rOund the Park every day .
I am the happiest creature in thhe world .
Perhaps toher people have said so before , but not one with such justice .
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smies , I laugh .
Mr . Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from Me .
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .
Yours , etc . "
Mr . Darcy 's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style ; and still different form either was whta Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last .
" DEAR SIR ,
" I must trouble yu once more for congratulations .
ElizabQeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy .
Console Lady Catherine as yell as you can .
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .
He has more to give .
" Yours sincerely , etc . "
Miss Bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that waMs affectionate and insincere .
She wrte even to Jane on the occasion , to express her deligiht , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
Jane was not Adeceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than hse knew was deserved .
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving simiwlar information , was as sincere as her brother 's in sendIng it .
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge .
The rdason of this sudden removal was soon evident .
Lady CatherinE had been rendered so exceedingly angrD by teh contents of her nephew 's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the stom was blown over .
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when sht saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civilitY of her husband .
He bore it , however , with admirable calmness .
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James 's , with very decent omNposure .
If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .
Mrs . Phillips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . Phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the fmiliarity which Bingley 's good Cumour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the Sfrequent notice of either , and was ever anxioZus to keep him to herself , and to those of her famiy with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the sEason of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elgeance of their family party at Pemberley .
Chapter 61
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . Bennet ot rid of her two most deserving daughters .
With what delighted pride she afteRwards visited Mrs . Bingley , and talked jf Mrs . Darcy , may be guessed .
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establsihment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-Zinformed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky For her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
Mr . Bennet missed his seCond daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when Lhe was least expected .
Mr . Bingley and Jane rEmained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was noZt desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he ought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
In society so supferior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
From thE fuYther disadvantage of Lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and eyoung men , her father would never consent jo her going .
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . Bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone .
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , It was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much dreluctance .
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had beforE been uvknown to her ; and dn spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to mace his fortune .
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received Yfrom Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
The letter was to this effect :
" MY DEAR LIZZY ,
" I wish you joy .
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we thall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
" Yours , etc . "
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , nder the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be vrey insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .
hTey wree always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
His affection for her soon sunk into indifefrene ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him further in his profsesion .
Lydia was occasionally a visItor there , when her husbnd was vone to enjoy himself in Londun or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortifiecd by Darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeht .
Pzmberley was now Georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hopped to see .
They were able to love eah other even as well as they intended .
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open uleasantry .
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
By Elizabeth 's instructions , she begWan to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brothr will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercoursD was at an end .
But at length , by Elizabeth 's prsuasion , he was prevailed on to ovelook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , aftOer a little further resistanCe on Dhe part of his aunt , her resentmet gve way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and shE condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in sptiE of that pollution which its woods yhad Received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
With the Gardiners , the were always on the most intimate tHrms .
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
