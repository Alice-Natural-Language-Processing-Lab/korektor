This paper describes a system for Czech spell-checking and diacritics
correction, Korektor. An HMM is used where the hidden states are bigrams of a
current and previous word tuple, where the tuple consists of the intended word
form, lemma, and tag. The emissions are the observed word form. The model is
log-linear and standard feature functions are used: n-grams of the word form,
morphological lemmas, and morphological tags. The features functions are
estimated using n-gram counts from a large training corpus of Czech newspapers.
The feature weights are first examined in a linear search, and then learned via
hill-climbing. The paper proposes a high precision, low recall error model
based on Church and Gale (1991). A letter n-gram model is trained on the same
newspaper corpus for diacritics completion. The system is evaluated on
diacritic completion accuracy, spell-checking F1, and on error correction of a
foreign-language-learner corpus.

While the paper presents a likely very useful piece of software in the form of
Korektor, it is difficult to understand what the specific research
contributions of this paper are. This is in part due to the lack of clear
citations and discussion of related work. There are also several issues with
the evaluation that may result in an unfair or biased comparison of Korektor
with the baseline methods.

Several aspects of the evaluation are concerning. First, the spell-checker
evaluation only compares to MS Word on one of the three datasets (Audio). The
claim that Korektor is a state-of-the-art spell-checker based on this single
dataset seems premature. While the margin between Korektor and MS Word is wide,
this could be due simply to a bias in the training data. Since MS Word is
effectively a black box, this seems like an unfair comparison. This same
problem applies to the comparison with CZACCENT, for which the training setup
is not specified, and may not be fairly comparable to the setup for Korektor.
Thus, in both cases, it may be the training data and not the model that cause
Korektor to outperform the baselines.

Second, the WebColl test set is annotated semi-automatically, by having humans
annotate only those errors found by Korektor. The paper correctly states that
evaluating recall on such a test set would be inappropriate. However, using
this dataset for accuracy as the paper does might also unfairly bias the subset
of errors towards ones Korektor is good at providing suggestions for.

The paper does not include a related work section. Korektor is evaluated
alongside CZACCENT for diacritics completion, but no description of the model
for CZACCENT is provided. Brill & Moore (2000) is only mentioned briefly in the
future work and very little other prior work in spell-checking is mentioned.

Much of this paper was difficult to follow. Notation is frequently used without
being clearly defined. Some terms, such as ‘real-word errors’, are never
defined. The paper mentions significant accuracy improvements, but does not
describe any statistical significance tests. Several aspects of the system are
underspecified, such as how the lemma forms are generated. The experimental
setup was not always clear, such as how the test datasets were used in the
diacritics completion experiment. Citations of background material, such as for
log-linear models (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Rosenfeld, 1994), are missing.

This paper describes a spell checker and diacritics completion for Czech
language.
The model is very straightforward and nothing special is assumed for Czech,
making the selection of Czech just an arbitrary choice.
Generally the paper is good for a system description, but I found nothing
interesting
both the model and uniqueness to Czech language in this paper.
For that reason, I cannot recommend this paper to appear at IJCNLP because it
will
not help other research in this area.

The authors describe a noisy channel model for Czech spelling correction and
accent completion.

The paper is generally clear and easy to follow. (There are a few places where
the English wasn't quite right, but nothing bad.) In terms of techniques, there
isn't a lot that's new here. They use a by-now standard log-linear model with
n-gram features based on words, their lemmas, and their part of speech tag.
(There's also a character n-gram model for accent correction.) The application
is important and they demonstrate its usefulness. They use their system to
automatically correct second language learners' essays with good performance.
On spelling correction, they beat MS Word handily.

Comments:

* I  believe that your corrector doesn't correct in-vocabulary spelling errors
(for instance it wouldn't catch the homophone error in this hear sentence.)
This is especially bad because you create the test set using your spelling
checker's vocabulary. Am I wrong here?

* It would be good to have some kind of baseline for accent correction, so that
we know how hard the task is. For example: for each (unaccented) form, replace
it with the most common accented one. How would that perform?
