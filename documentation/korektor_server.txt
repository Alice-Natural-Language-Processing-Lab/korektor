The korektor_server is REST server binary.

It is enabled only on UNIX and when -DWITH_REST_SERVER=1 is passed to cmake.

The REST server uses libmicrohttpd as a HTTP server. The libmicrohttpd library
must be compiled in rest_server/libmicrohttpd directory, which can be achieved
by running get.sh and then build.sh in that directory.

The resulting binary is executed as
  korektor_server [-d] port (spellchecker_name spellchecker_file)*
The -d option daemonizes the server after loading the module, port specifies
the port of the HTTP server. The reset of arguments specifies models which to
use.

The REST server accepts GET and POST requests to address /spellchecker_name,
with data field containing the data to correct. Apart from specified model names,
model "strip_diacritics" strips diacritics.
