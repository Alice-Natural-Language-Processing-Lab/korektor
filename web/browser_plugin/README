Korektor Spellchecker
=====================

Korektor Spellchecker extension allows using Korektor service
(spellchecker and occassional grammarchecker developed at Institute
of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University in Prague)
on any editable input fields of web pages.

The extension allows either directly correcting the content, or showing
a dialog with suggested corrections. Note that the dialog with
suggestions is injected directly into the original page, so there
can be various problems on untested sites. However, the extension seem
to work fine on many sites.

Although the sources of Korektor service and this extension are available
under BSD-3-Clause license, please respect the CC BY-SA-NC licence
of the spellchecking models.

the Korektor itself is available from http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/korektor .
